How to build a [Librato](https://librato.com) dashboard powered by a [Raspberri Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/). Or, how to auto-boot a [Raspberri Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) to a fullscreen webpage.

Step 1: Buy some stuff
----------------------
Here's what I bought for this project:
 * [Raspberry Pi Model B Revision 2.0 (512MB)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009SQQF9C?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B009SQQF9C&linkCode=shr&tag=johnwulffcom-20&psc=1)
 * [Raspberry Pi Clear Case](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TCUXLW?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B008TCUXLW&linkCode=shr&tag=johnwulffcom-20&psc=1)
 * [USB Wall Charger with Micro USB Data Cable](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LFXBJG?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B005LFXBJG&linkCode=shr&tag=johnwulffcom-20&psc=1)

The Raspberri Pi comes with onboard ethernet but if you want to use WiFi, you'll want a [USB Wifi Adapter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MTTJOY?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B003MTTJOY&linkCode=shr&tag=johnwulffcom-20&psc=1).

Any display that the Raspberri Pi can drive will work but I recommend something with a lot of pixels (1080p or better). I went with this one, [Samsung 32-Inch LED HDTV](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCGRXD8?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B00BCGRXD8&linkCode=shr&tag=johnwulffcom-20&psc=1). You're probably going to want to put it on the wall, so get a [wall mount](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TZ4CRG?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B002TZ4CRG&linkCode=shr&tag=johnwulffcom-20&psc=1) too. Don't forget an [HDMI cable](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005T3LKKM?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B005T3LKKM&linkCode=shr&tag=johnwulffcom-20).
