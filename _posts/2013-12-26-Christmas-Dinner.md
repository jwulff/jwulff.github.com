We hosted Christmas Dinner 2013 at our house. Courtney, Mark, Bill, Betty, 
Megan, and Michael came over.

## The Menu
* Canlis Salad, recipe from [Canlis](http://canlis.com/food/recipes/the-canlis-salad/)
* Chicken Pot Pies, from [Dot's Delicatessen](http://dotsdelicatessen.com/)
* Hasselback Potato Gratin, [recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/12/hasselback-potato-gratin-casserole-holiday-food-lab.html) by the great [J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt](https://twitter.com/thefoodlab)
